<span class="first-letter">T</span>here is a plethora of amazing research conducted every day at lab benches, at computers, on paper, and out in the field by scientists and engineers at Caltech. Traditionally, the results of this work are shared at conferences or in scientific journals in language meant for other scientists. Here at Caltech Letters, we believe in the importance of moving beyond the scientific sphere and inviting the public to be a part of the incredible work that goes on here.

Caltech Letters was founded in 2017 with two separate but synergistic purposes: first, to provide the greater community with a window into the exciting world of scientific discovery, and second, to help Caltech researchers hone their science communication skills by writing concise, accessible articles about their work. Check out our Science tab to see the latest and greatest from our campus labs.

We also elevate Caltech community voices on non-scientific topics they have wrestled with at Caltech, such as mental health, child care, and diversity in science. Click on Viewpoints for pieces about these issues and others.

**Interested in sharing your science, but not sure you're much of a writer? Trust us, you're perfect for Caltech Letters.** 

<!-- So, you're a member of the Caltech community working on an important problem that might one day really help people. In the immortal words of Dr. Strangelove, 
> Why didn’t you tell the world?

Get in touch with us at [letters@caltech.edu](mailto:letters@caltech.edu?subject=Caltech Letters) to get writing! Our [dedicated team](/about) will help get your piece shipshape.

We believe that effectively communicating research is crucial to success in STEM—a belief that’s not reflected in the amount of time and energy spent training scientists to write.  And that’s where we come in. Whether you’re a seasoned writer or your magnum opus is but a tweet, our team of experienced editors can help you take your research *out of the lab* and *into context*.  If you believe your research is important (and we sure hope you do), we want to hear about it.

**Ready to write?** We want articles aimed at an intellectually curious audience that doesn’t necessarily have a background in science.  

**Want to write, but you’re not sure how to get started?** Contact one of our editors and pitch your idea! We can help you craft a story out of your science, and we want your authentic voice to shine through.

**Interested, but you’re swamped in lab right now?** Let us know and we’ll reach out with a gentle reminder in a few weeks.

We're looking for pieces between 500 and 1500 words in length in your voice. Contact the editor with pitches, questions and suggestions at [letters@caltech.edu](mailto:letters@caltech.edu?subject=Caltech Letters). 

Well, what are you waiting for?  Get writing! -->


<!-- Caltech Letters is a new online publication geared towards bringing you world-class research in the words of the researchers themselves. We help members of the Caltech community communicate their research and share their viewpoints on the interplay between science and the broader world. The articles are written for non-specialists, to allow readers to grasp the significance of the work and take part in the surrounding discussion without a deep background in the specific field. Our mission is strongly underscored by a deep-seated commitment to elevating and centering traditionally underrepresented voices in science, and our sincere intention is that, through our diverse editorial board and pool of writers, we will strive to create a more interconnected and inclusive campus. We want to hear your thoughts in the comments section beneath each article, where we hope to foster discussion between readers, whether at Caltech or around the world, and with the authors themselves. We hope you join the conversation! -->

<!-- But wait, now you're a hard-working citizen curious where your hard-earned tax dollars are going. Caltech Letters is an online publication bringing you world-class research straight from the horse's mouth! 

We want to bridge the gap between Caltech scientists and the general public, all the while helping researchers improve their communication skills.-->

Caltech Letters is not a publication of California Institute of Technology. See our [disclaimer](/disclaimer) for more information.

<!-- This idea for Caltech Letters was conceived by a small group of graduate students concerned about the difficulty students face in gaining perspective on what their research means for society and the serious lack of a campus space for students to discuss their work with others. As such, our purpose with this endeavor is twofold. Caltech Letters serves as a unique platform for Caltech students to share their research and their perspectives on science and technology with a broader audience and learn about the phenomenally exciting work and ideas of their peers. In addition, students will improve their science communication with help from our experienced editorial team, with an eye toward better preparing for future grant proposals, research papers, and job applications. We encourage students to write about the research they are developing, their perspectives on science stories in the news, their viewpoints on the academic lifestyle or the social culture of the scientific community, their ideas on the growing role of technology in our society, and much more. Our mission is strongly underscored by a deep-seated commitment to elevating and centering traditionally underrepresented voices in science, and our sincere intention is that, through our diverse editorial board and pool of writers, we will strive to create a more interconnected and inclusive campus.  -->

<!-- Caltech Letters is a platform for members of the Caltech community to communicate their science (and views on their science) to a wider audience. Being able to do this is not only good for the public understanding of science, but it can also develop the confidence and communication skills crucial for job applications and grant writing!

If you’re a member of the Caltech community (undergrad, grad, faculty, staff and beyond) and you’re interested in writing for us, we want to hear from you! We're looking for contributions from as many people as possible, whether you’re a closet Hemingway or you're totally new to this game. You could write about some research you’ve just published, a science story in the news, your thoughts on the academic lifestyle or diversity in science and much more besides.  -->
