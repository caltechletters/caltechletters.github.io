<!-- This idea for Caltech Letters was conceived by a small group of graduate students concerned about the difficulty students face in gaining perspective on what their research means for society and the serious lack of a campus space for students to discuss their work with others. As such, our purpose with this endeavor is twofold. Caltech Letters serves as a unique platform for Caltech students to share their research and their perspectives on science and technology with a broader audience and learn about the phenomenally exciting work and ideas of their peers. In addition, students will improve their science communication with help from our experienced editorial team, with an eye toward better preparing for future grant proposals, research papers, and job applications. We encourage students to write about the research they are developing, their perspectives on science stories in the news, their viewpoints on the academic lifestyle or the social culture of the scientific community, their ideas on the growing role of technology in our society, and much more. Our mission is strongly underscored by a deep-seated commitment to elevating and centering traditionally underrepresented voices in science, and our sincere intention is that, through our diverse editorial board and pool of writers, we will strive to create a more interconnected and inclusive campus. -->

<!-- Caltech Letters is a platform for members of the Caltech community to communicate their science (and views on their science) to a wider audience. Being able to do this is not only good for the public understanding of science, but it can also develop the confidence and communication skills crucial for job applications and grant writing! -->

<!-- If you’re a member of the Caltech community (undergrad, grad, faculty, staff and beyond) and you’re interested in writing for us, we want to hear from you! We're looking for contributions from as many people as possible, whether you’re a closet Hemingway or you're totally new to this game. You could write about some research you’ve just published, a science story in the news, your thoughts on the academic lifestyle or diversity in science and much more besides. -->
