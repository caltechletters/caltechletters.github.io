It’s easy to think of socially rich cultures as a uniquely human phenomenon. However, even animals with much smaller brains exhibit culture all their own! We discuss what this looks like in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/1997/12/10/monkey-culture/7d0918a9-22da-4e06-92b7-e9546789fe69/" target="_blank">macaques</a> (monkeys) and <a href="http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4344839&blobtype=pdf" target="_blank">birds</a> before tackling the real kicker: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat1590" target="_blank">culture in fruit flies</a>. As a fun aside, sleeping in is a cultural trait in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.0611" target="_blank">meerkats</a>! How does evolution and a universal need to fit in contribute to building these cultures? Tune in to find out!

Aditi, John, Julian, and Lev also discuss how fitting in and academic lab culture influenced how they picked their research group for graduate school.
