Not My Thesis is a podcast that reveals all the unpublished parts of the scientific process. We interview graduate students at Caltech about what their thesis is, but also what their thesis isnâ€™t. We want to understand not just what they do, but how they do it, why they do it, and how the other parts of their life all feed into their passion for science. Join us as we seek to understand science via the hearts and minds creating it.
