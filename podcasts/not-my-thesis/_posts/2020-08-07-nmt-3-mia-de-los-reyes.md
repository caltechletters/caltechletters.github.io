In Chapter 3 of Not My Thesis, Mia de los Reyes discusses the galaxies lurking in the empty parts of space, the constraints of working with light, and how she’s helped expand the membership of the scientific community. Astronomy, Mia reminds us, may not always be useful. But it is certainly cool.

You can find more information about galaxies eating each other <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/108696/vampire-galaxy-sucks-star-forming-gas-from-its-neighbors/" target="_blank">here</a> and read about our collision with Andromeda <a href="https://www.space.com/15949-milkyway-galaxy-crash-andromeda-hubble.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
