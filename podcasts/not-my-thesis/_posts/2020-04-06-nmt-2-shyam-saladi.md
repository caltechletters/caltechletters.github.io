Scientific impact can take many forms. Sometimes a highly-cited paper influences the most people, sometimes it’s a nifty website, and sometimes it can be just a few words of kindness.

In Chapter 2 of Not My Thesis, <a href="https://shyam.saladi.org/" target="_blank">Shyam Saladi</a> talks about everything from meticulous models of biological molecules to an automated service which literally changes the way we see our science. Reflecting on his work, he provides insight into what meaningful science is.

You can find Shyam’s paper on modeling membrane protein gene expression <a href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.001052" target="_blank">here</a>, and learn more about the JetFighter <a href="https://elifesciences.org/labs/c2292989/jetfighter-towards-figure-accuracy-and-accessibility" target="_blank">here</a>.
