In Chapter 4 of Not My Thesis, Jane Panangaden explains the abstract world of pure math and the delights of exploring it, as well as her work advocating for tenantsâ€™ rights in Pasadena. While dividing her time between writing proofs and legislation, Jane grapples with how we apply our skills, technical or otherwise, to bring a different world into existence. She asks us to consider: why do math?
